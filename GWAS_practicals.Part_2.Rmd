# Outline of the practicals

The practical session consists of five steps:

 1. Exploring phenotype data
 2. Exploring genotype data
 3. Quality control of genotype data
 4. Association analysis and GWAS
 5. Vizualization of the results

## Loading genotype data

Load GenABEL package
 
```{r}
library(GenABEL)
```

Load phenotype and genotype data

```{r}

data("ge03d2")


```

Let's get the Structure of ge03d2 object

```{r}
str(ge03d2)
```

## Summary of genotype data

Let's have a look at the summary of the genotype data.

How many IDs and SNPs do we have in our data?

```{r}
nids(ge03d2)
nsnps(ge03d2)
```
